      "I took the lead in developing the frontend of the Exo-Planet Predictor website, where the focus was on integrating a robust machine learning model. This model is designed to predict the habitability of exoplanets by analyzing a diverse set of features, including mass, radius, and orbital characteristics. The frontend of the website was crafted to offer users an intuitive and engaging experience, allowing them to input relevant data and receive insightful predictions about the potential habitability of exoplanets. The combination of a user-friendly interface and a sophisticated machine learning model positions Exo-Planet Predictor as a valuable tool for enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone interested in exploring the possibilities of habitable exoplanets.",
